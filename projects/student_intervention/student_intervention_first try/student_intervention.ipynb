    "Random forrest\n",
    "A random forrest is an ensamble method for classification, regression and other tasks. that fits n decision tree classifiers on a number of sub-samples of the dataset. The random forrest differ from standard tree classifiers by using a modified tree algorithm, that selects at each candidate split in the learning process a random subset of the features. It uses averaging to improve the predicive accuracy and control overfitting. Each trees are trained on various sub-samples of the whole training set, of the original input samples, drawn with replacement. Decision trees are grown very deep resulting in a low bias and high variance. By averaging the random trees trained of different part of the same dataset the goal is to reduce the variance. However this comes on the expense of a small increase in bias and loss of interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "k-nearest neighbors algorithm - This is a relatively simple model that can be used for both regression and classification. For classification an object is classified based on majority vote of the k nearest objects based on their class, where k is an integer. Also it is possible to assign weight based on how close the object is. E.g 1/d wher d is the distance. The model is easy to understand and it is straight forward to evaluate the classifications of the model. However the model has short comings if there are local structures in the data that cannot be captured.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Trees - This classifier uses a decision tree to map observations about objects to draw conclusion. It consists of leafs and branches. Where each leaf represents a decision on a feature variable and branches out to new leafs, ending up in the end on a decision predicting the target variable. The model is particularly good for mining and for visualisation, as the tree is more easily understood compared to a black box algorithm. However a decision tree is prone to overfitting as the tree can grow too large if not pruned to avoid overfitting. Also at each decision is prone to fall into local minima as the decisions are made locally for each leaf. There are also consepts that decision trees have problems with representing without becoming overly complex, or not at all, such as the XOR function.\n",

    "We can see that both the KNeigboorsClassifier and DecisionTreeClassifier gets an F1 score of 1.000 but a lower test score. Which is due to overfitting the training data. The RandomForrestClassifier (RF) gets the highest F1 Score on the test set of 0.7941 for 200 samples in the training set. The prediction time of RF classifier increases linearly with more samples. It takes 0.0030 seconds for 300 students. That is 0.00001 seconds per students. Meaning that making predictions for a million students should take 10 seconds. Which means that even though it is slowe than the DecisionTreeClassifier it is still more than fast enough with the current hardware to be used in production. \n",

E.g \"Is X a romantic movie?\", \"Does Johnny Depp star in the movie?\" an so on. He asks informative questions first the gives me a yes or no question at the end. By doing this Steve has created a decision tree for my movie preferences. But Steve is only human and does not generalize my taste and preferences well. (He overfits). In order to get more accurate recomendations I ask a group of my friends if I will like the movie in the same way, i.e making them vote. Now my friends are decision trees will make up the forrest.

    "The tunes model has an F1 score of 0.7891 which is higher than the F1 score for the untuned model, however the untuned model has a higher score at 200 samples (F1=0.7941) than for 300 samples (F1=0.7914). Also the untuned model is a subset of the parameters in the grid search, which we then expect to give the same F1 score as previously. However since the forrest is random this is not always the case that we get the same forrest each time, which results in different F1 scores. In this case we get a range of scores that overlap when we retrain even for higher sample sizes and different parameters. This means most likely that higher model complexity does not result in a higher score. Which is expected from a bias variance tradeoff. Where the error from variances increases for higher model complexity. What likely happens is that the variance increases and that the increase in n_estimators does not capture any more information from the data."
